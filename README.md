Project Title: Responsive Landing Page
Overview

In this project, we have created a responsive landing page that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This landing page consists of multiple sections, including a hero section, sign-up section, features section, filters section, quotes section, and footer.

The project is built using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on responsive design, using media queries to adjust the layout and styling of the page according to the screen size.
Project Sections

1. Hero Section

The hero section features a fullscreen background image, a heading, a sub-heading, and a call-to-action button. On smaller screens, the heading and sub-heading font sizes are reduced, and the layout is adjusted for better readability.

2. Sign-up Section

The sign-up section includes a background image, a form to capture user information, and a call-to-action button. The layout of this section is adjusted to accommodate smaller screen sizes, with the form being hidden on devices with a width of 800px or less.

3. Features Section

This section showcases various features of the product, using a flexbox layout to display three cards with images and text. On smaller screens, the layout switches to a single-column format, and font sizes are adjusted to maintain readability.

4. Filters Section

The filters section demonstrates the filtering capabilities of the product, displaying a grid of images with accompanying text. The layout and styling of this section are adapted for smaller screens, with some elements being hidden or resized as necessary.

5. Quotes Section

The quotes section displays a quote and its citation using a grid layout. On smaller screens, the layout is adjusted, and the font sizes of the quote and citation are modified for better readability.

6. Footer

The footer includes copyright information and social media icons. Font sizes and the layout are adjusted for smaller screens to maintain a clean and readable appearance.
